# Team Profile Generator

## Description

This assignment is to build a Node.js command line application to where businesses cam enter information about employees on a software engineering team that will generate an HTML document in which displays summaries of each person. 

I can't seem to figure out the Engineer errors that I have ran into, but I was able to generate the other employee information into the generated HTML document
